it should not be possible to move to lava either as a target or as passing during free move unless it is safe (flying, resist, absorb, etc)

Fire Walk should be treated like a teleport type of movement, there is no passing through tiles between the source and destination either for the engine or for the visual movement.

Bombs should be more consistent (tick down each turn, explode when timer runs out), currently the timer is stuck at 2.

prevent clicking on a tile's text and selecting it.

Return to Command Center does not work
