it should not be possible to move to lava either as a target or as passing during free move unless it is safe (flying, resist, absorb, etc) STILL TO DO

Fire Walk should be treated like a teleport type of movement, there is no passing through tiles between the source and destination either for the engine or for the visual movement. STILL TO DO

Bombs should be more consistent (tick down each turn, explode when timer runs out), currently the timer is stuck at 2.

prevent clicking on a tile's text and selecting it. STILL TO DO

Jump does not stun anymore, it should.

Jump target preview shows an enemy, but clicking on it says 'Target out of reach or blocked!'. This shows a disconnect between the preview and the actual action. CRITICAL ISSUE
